# SCS Config Server .NET Configuration Provider

This project contains the [Spring Cloud Services - Config Server](http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) client config provider.  By acting as a client to the Spring Cloud Services - Config Server, this provider enables the Config Server to become a source of configuration data for a .NET application.  You can learn more about Cloud Native Applications and the Spring Cloud Services - Config Server at [Spring Cloud Services](http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/index.html).
